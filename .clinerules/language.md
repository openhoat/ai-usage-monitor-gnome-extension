# Language Rule

This rule ensures that all public content in the project is written in English for international accessibility.

All content must be in English:
- Documentation files (README.md, CHANGELOG.md, KANBAN.md)
- Code comments
- Git commit messages

Technical terms and proper nouns remain in their original language.
