# Markdown Formatting Rule

No unnecessary blank lines except the last one.

When editing markdown files:
- Do NOT add consecutive blank lines between paragraphs or sections
- Use exactly one blank line between paragraphs or sections
- Use exactly one blank line after headings
- Ensure exactly one blank line at the end of files
